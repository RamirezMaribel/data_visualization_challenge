Module 5 Challenge

This challenge was to analyse data from an a study of 249 mice and the tested drug regimens over the course of 45 days. Their main focus was the drug named Capomulin. Through the analysis we see that it has positive affects and may lead to more study and treatments of squamous cell carcinoma (skin cancer).

Analysis: 
-The bar graph shows that there are clearly more mice that were tested with the drugs Capomulin (230) and Ramicane (228). From cell 16 of the pymaceuticals_hw.ipynb file

-Looking at the 4 box plots of the 4 chosen drugs, Capomulin data is mostly clustered closer to the median than the other 3 drugs. Capomulin's inter quartile range was the smallest (7.78) out of all four drugs. From cell 24 of the pymaceuticals_hw.ipynb file

-The regression analysis shows that as the weight of the mice changed so did the the average tumor volume. It has a strong correlation since the pearson r value was .84. There's a good chance that if there was more data for the Capomulin mice, that the data would land close or cluster around the plotted line. From cell 33 of the pymaceuticals_hw.ipynb file
